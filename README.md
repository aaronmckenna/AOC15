# AOC15
Advent of Code 2015

This is a way for me to figure out *how* I want to do things. I currently use Sublime Text 3 for my text editor, but I could also learn Vim, Emacs, etc, in the process.
This is also a method for figuring out what languages I want to progress with. They could be really popular ones, like C++, Rust, or I might enjoy using unpopular ones
like COBOL. 

## My Rules
- Each day must have a README.md going over the language, architecture, and naming conventions of the program.
- I may use any language I see fit, but I am not allowed to use the same language twice in a row.
- I may reference books for solutions (for example, *Introduction to Algorthims*), in which I must add that fact to the README.
- I can use any tools I see fit. If I use any external tools, say a debugger, I must reference that in the README. I must reference what text editor I'm using as well.
